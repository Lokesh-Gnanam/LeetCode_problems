Hint
You are given a binary string s. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:

Type-1: Remove the character at the start of the string s and append it to the end of the string.
Type-2: Pick any character in s and flip its value, i.e., if its value is '0' it becomes '1' and vice-versa.
Return the minimum number of type-2 operations you need to perform such that s becomes alternating.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal.

For example, the strings "010" and "1010" are alternating, while the string "0100" is not.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "111000"
Output: 2
Explanation: Use the first operation two times to make s = "100011".
Then, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s = "101010".
Example 2:

Input: s = "010"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already alternating.
Example 3:

Input: s = "1110"
Output: 1
Explanation: Use the second operation on the second element to make s = "1010".


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        string t = s + s;

        int ans = n;
        int mis0 = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < 2*n; i++) {

            char expected = (i % 2 == 0) ? '0' : '1';

            if(t[i] != expected) mis0++;

            if(i >= n) {
                int left = i - n;
                char exp_left = (left % 2 == 0) ? '0' : '1';
                if(t[left] != exp_left) mis0--;
            }

            if(i >= n - 1) {
                int mis1 = n - mis0;
                ans = min(ans, min(mis0, mis1));
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

Hint
Given an array of strings nums containing n unique binary strings each of length n, return a binary string of length n that does not appear in nums. If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = ["01","10"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.
Example 2:

Input: nums = ["00","01"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "10" would also be correct.
Example 3:

Input: nums = ["111","011","001"]
Output: "101"
Explanation: "101" does not appear in nums. "000", "010", "100", and "110" would also be correct.
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 16
nums[i].length == n
nums[i] is either '0' or '1'.
All the strings of nums are unique.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findDifferentBinaryString(vector<string>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int size = pow(2, n);

        vector<int> nu(size, 0);

        for(string num : nums){
            int val = stoi(num, nullptr, 2);
            nu[val]++;
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
            if(nu[i] == 0){
                string ans = bitset<32>(i).to_string();
                ans = ans.substr(32 - n);
                return ans;
            }
        }

        return string(n, '0');

Hint
You are given 3 positive integers zero, one, and limit.

A binary array arr is called stable if:

The number of occurrences of 0 in arr is exactly zero.
The number of occurrences of 1 in arr is exactly one.
Each subarray of arr with a size greater than limit must contain both 0 and 1.
Return the total number of stable binary arrays.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: zero = 1, one = 1, limit = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

The two possible stable binary arrays are [1,0] and [0,1], as both arrays have a single 0 and a single 1, and no subarray has a length greater than 2.

Example 2:

Input: zero = 1, one = 2, limit = 1

Output: 1

Explanation:

The only possible stable binary array is [1,0,1].

Note that the binary arrays [1,1,0] and [0,1,1] have subarrays of length 2 with identical elements, hence, they are not stable.

Example 3:

Input: zero = 3, one = 3, limit = 2

Output: 14

Explanation:

All the possible stable binary arrays are [0,0,1,0,1,1], [0,0,1,1,0,1], [0,1,0,0,1,1], [0,1,0,1,0,1], [0,1,0,1,1,0], [0,1,1,0,0,1], [0,1,1,0,1,0], [1,0,0,1,0,1], [1,0,0,1,1,0], [1,0,1,0,0,1], [1,0,1,0,1,0], [1,0,1,1,0,0], [1,1,0,0,1,0], and [1,1,0,1,0,0].

 

Constraints:

1 <= zero, one, limit <= 200

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfStableArrays(int zero, int one, int limit) {
        static int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

        for (int i = 1; i <= min(zero, limit); i++) {

        }   

        for (int j = 1; j <= min(one, limit); j++) {
            dp1[0][j] = 1;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= zero; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= one; j++) {
                // dp0[i][j]:
                // Add one more zero to states with (i-1, j),
                // then remove the invalid states where the zero-run becomes > limit
                long long val0 = (long long)dp0[i - 1][j] + dp1[i - 1][j];
                if (i - limit - 1 >= 0) {
                    val0 -= dp1[i - limit - 1][j];
                }
                dp0[i][j] = (val0 % MOD + MOD) % MOD;

                // dp1[i][j]:
                // Add one more one to states with (i, j-1),
                // then remove the invalid states where the one-run becomes > limit
                long long val1 = (long long)dp0[i][j - 1] + dp1[i][j - 1];
                if (j - limit - 1 >= 0) {
                    val1 -= dp0[i][j - limit - 1];
                }
                dp1[i][j] = (val1 % MOD + MOD) % MOD;
            }
            
        }
        return ((long long)dp0[zero][one] + dp1[zero][one]) % MOD;
    }
};

Hint
The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
Given an integer n, return its complement.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
Example 2:

Input: n = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.
Example 3:

Input: n = 10
Output: 5
Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.
 

Constraints:

0 <= n < 109
 

Note: This question is the same as 476: [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/)

## 3600. Maximize Spanning Tree Stability with Upgrades [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-spanning-tree-stability-with-upgrades/?envType=daily-question&envId=2026-03-12)
Solved
Hard
Topics

Hint
You are given an integer n, representing n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and a list of edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, si, musti]:

ui and vi indicates an undirected edge between nodes ui and vi.
si is the strength of the edge.
musti is an integer (0 or 1). If musti == 1, the edge must be included in the spanning tree. These edges cannot be upgraded.
You are also given an integer k, the maximum number of upgrades you can perform. Each upgrade doubles the strength of an edge, and each eligible edge (with musti == 0) can be upgraded at most once.

The stability of a spanning tree is defined as the minimum strength score among all edges included in it.

Return the maximum possible stability of any valid spanning tree. If it is impossible to connect all nodes, return -1.

Note: A spanning tree of a graph with n nodes is a subset of the edges that connects all nodes together (i.e. the graph is connected) without forming any cycles, and uses exactly n - 1 edges.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2,1],[1,2,3,0]], k = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

Edge [0,1] with strength = 2 must be included in the spanning tree.
Edge [1,2] is optional and can be upgraded from 3 to 6 using one upgrade.
The resulting spanning tree includes these two edges with strengths 2 and 6.
The minimum strength in the spanning tree is 2, which is the maximum possible stability.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,4,0],[1,2,3,0],[0,2,1,0]], k = 2

Output: 6

Explanation:

Since all edges are optional and up to k = 2 upgrades are allowed.
Upgrade edges [0,1] from 4 to 8 and [1,2] from 3 to 6.
The resulting spanning tree includes these two edges with strengths 8 and 6.
The minimum strength in the tree is 6, which is the maximum possible stability.
Example 3:

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1,1],[1,2,1,1],[2,0,1,1]], k = 0

Output: -1

Explanation:

All edges are mandatory and form a cycle, which violates the spanning tree property of acyclicity. Thus, the answer is -1.

Hint
You are given an integer mountainHeight denoting the height of a mountain.

You are also given an integer array workerTimes representing the work time of workers in seconds.

The workers work simultaneously to reduce the height of the mountain. For worker i:

To decrease the mountain's height by x, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 + ... + workerTimes[i] * x seconds. For example:
To reduce the height of the mountain by 1, it takes workerTimes[i] seconds.
To reduce the height of the mountain by 2, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 seconds, and so on.
Return an integer representing the minimum number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: mountainHeight = 4, workerTimes = [2,1,1]

Output: 3

Explanation:

One way the height of the mountain can be reduced to 0 is:

Worker 0 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[0] = 2 seconds.
Worker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 = 3 seconds.
Worker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[2] = 1 second.
Since they work simultaneously, the minimum time needed is max(2, 3, 1) = 3 seconds.

Example 2:

Input: mountainHeight = 10, workerTimes = [3,2,2,4]

Output: 12

Explanation:

Worker 0 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 = 9 seconds.
Worker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12 seconds.
Worker 2 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[2] + workerTimes[2] * 2 + workerTimes[2] * 3 = 12 seconds.
Worker 3 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[3] + workerTimes[3] * 2 = 12 seconds.
The number of seconds needed is max(9, 12, 12, 12) = 12 seconds.

Example 3:

Input: mountainHeight = 5, workerTimes = [1]

Output: 15

Explanation:

There is only one worker in this example, so the answer is workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 + workerTimes[0] * 3 + workerTimes[0] * 4 + workerTimes[0] * 5 = 15.

```cpp
using ll = long long;
class Solution {
public:
    ll minNumberOfSeconds(int height, vector<int>& times) {
        ll lo = 1, hi = 1e16;

        while (lo < hi) {
            ll mid = (lo + hi) >> 1;
            ll tot = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < times.size() && tot < height; i++)
                tot += (ll)(sqrt((double)mid / times[i] * 2 + 0.25) - 0.5);
            if (tot >= height)
                hi = mid;
            else
                lo = mid + 1;
        }

        return lo;
    }
};

For example, strings "abc", "ac", "b" and "abcbabcbcb" are all happy strings and strings "aa", "baa" and "ababbc" are not happy strings.

Given two integers n and k, consider a list of all happy strings of length n sorted in lexicographical order.

Return the kth string of this list or return an empty string if there are less than k happy strings of length n.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1, k = 3
Output: "c"
Explanation: The list ["a", "b", "c"] contains all happy strings of length 1. The third string is "c".
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, k = 4
Output: ""
Explanation: There are only 3 happy strings of length 1.
Example 3:

Input: n = 3, k = 9
Output: "cab"
Explanation: There are 12 different happy string of length 3 ["aba", "abc", "aca", "acb", "bab", "bac", "bca", "bcb", "cab", "cac", "cba", "cbc"]. You will find the 9th string = "cab"
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10
1 <= k <= 100

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string getHappyString(int n, int k) {

        int total = 3 * (1<<(n-1));
        if(k>total) return "";

        k--;
        string res="";
        char last='\0';

        for(int pos=0;pos<n;pos++){

            int branch=1<<(n-pos-1);

            vector<char> choices;
            for(char c:{'a','b','c'})
                if(c!=last) choices.push_back(c);

            int idx=k/branch;
            res+=choices[idx];
            last=choices[idx];
            k%=branch;
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

Hint
Write an API that generates fancy sequences using the append, addAll, and multAll operations.

Implement the Fancy class:

Fancy() Initializes the object with an empty sequence.
void append(val) Appends an integer val to the end of the sequence.
void addAll(inc) Increments all existing values in the sequence by an integer inc.
void multAll(m) Multiplies all existing values in the sequence by an integer m.
int getIndex(idx) Gets the current value at index idx (0-indexed) of the sequence modulo 109 + 7. If the index is greater or equal than the length of the sequence, return -1.
 

Example 1:

Input
["Fancy", "append", "addAll", "append", "multAll", "getIndex", "addAll", "append", "multAll", "getIndex", "getIndex", "getIndex"]
[[], [2], [3], [7], [2], [0], [3], [10], [2], [0], [1], [2]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, null, 10, null, null, null, 26, 34, 20]

Explanation
Fancy fancy = new Fancy();
fancy.append(2);   // fancy sequence: [2]
fancy.addAll(3);   // fancy sequence: [2+3] -> [5]
fancy.append(7);   // fancy sequence: [5, 7]
fancy.multAll(2);  // fancy sequence: [5*2, 7*2] -> [10, 14]
fancy.getIndex(0); // return 10
fancy.addAll(3);   // fancy sequence: [10+3, 14+3] -> [13, 17]
fancy.append(10);  // fancy sequence: [13, 17, 10]
fancy.multAll(2);  // fancy sequence: [13*2, 17*2, 10*2] -> [26, 34, 20]
fancy.getIndex(0); // return 26
fancy.getIndex(1); // return 34
fancy.getIndex(2); // return 20
 

Constraints:

1 <= val, inc, m <= 100
0 <= idx <= 105
At most 105 calls total will be made to append, addAll, multAll, and getIndex.
 
```cpp
class Fancy {
public:
    const long long MOD = 1000000007;
    vector<long long> seq;
    long long mul = 1;
    long long add = 0;

    long long modInverse(long long x) {
        long long res = 1, p = MOD - 2;
        while (p) {
            if (p & 1) res = (res * x) % MOD;
            x = (x * x) % MOD;
            p >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }

    Fancy() {}

    void append(int val) {
        long long inv = modInverse(mul);
        long long stored = ((val - add + MOD) % MOD * inv) % MOD;
        seq.push_back(stored);
    }

    void addAll(int inc) {
        add = (add + inc) % MOD;
    }

    void multAll(int m) {
        mul = (mul * m) % MOD;
        add = (add * m) % MOD;
    }

    int getIndex(int idx) {
        if (idx >= seq.size()) return -1;
        return (seq[idx] * mul % MOD + add) % MOD;
    }
};
```
